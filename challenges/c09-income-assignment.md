*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

*Reading*: - [Using ACS Estimates and Margin of
Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)

Uncertainty in the American Community
Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622813002518?casa_token=VddzQ1-spHMAAAAA:FTq92LXgiPVloJUVjnHs8Ma1HwvPigisAYtzfqaGbbRRwoknNq56Y2IzszmGgIGH4JAPzQN0)

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and
supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit
a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "C:/Users/mfox/OneDrive - Olin College of Engineering/Data Science/data-science-S2025/challenges/data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), ~ suppressWarnings(as.numeric(.)))) %>%
## TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(Geography, `Geographic Area Name`),
    names_to = c(".value", "category"),
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error)!!.*!!(\\d-person families)"
  ) %>%
  rename(
    geographic_area_name = `Geographic Area Name`,
    income_estimate = Estimate,
    income_moe = `Margin of Error`
  )

df_q3 %>% 
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 16,100
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Geography            <chr> "0500000US01001", "0500000US01001", "0500000US010…

    ## $ income_moe           <dbl> 6663, 14181, 10692, 20739, 12387, 2297, 8851, 519…

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
df_q4 <- df_q3 %>%
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe / 1.645,
    income_lo = income_estimate - qnorm(0.995) * income_SE,
    income_hi = income_estimate + qnorm(0.995) * income_SE,
    income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate
  )

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

    ## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
    ## ℹ In argument: `county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! `fct_reorder()` removing 2 missing values.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = TRUE` to silence this message.
    ## ℹ Use `.na_rm = FALSE` to preserve NAs.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - Larger households generally report higher median incomes.
  - Some counties have overlapping income ranges, making it hard to
    confidently determine ones income is definitely higher than another.
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - Suffolk county has the smallest confidence intervals, making it
    easier to distinguish between different household incomes. However,
    the confidence intervals are not negligible, so you cannot
    confidently give a single number for median household income.
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket, Dukes, and Hampshire have the widest intervals.

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
df_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = population_estimate, y = income_SE, color = category)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(
    title = "Standard Error of Income Estimate vs. Population by County",
    x = "County Population (log scale)",
    y = "Income Standard Error (log scale)",
    color = "Family Size"
  )
```

    ## Warning: Removed 814 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

![](c09-income-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q7-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - There is a clear negative relationship between standard error and
    population size as population increases, the standard error tends to
    decrease.
  - Larger populations allow for larger sample sizes in the survey,
    decreasing sampling variability. This allows for more precise
    estimates of the median income.
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - Large counties provide more precise estimates with narrower
    confidence intervals.
  - Small counties estimates come with larger margins of error, making
    it difficult to make confident comparisons or detect differences
    between household types or with other counties.

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data
# Find counties where median income *decreases* as family size increases

df_income_wide <- df_data %>%
  select(geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = category, values_from = income_estimate) %>%
  drop_na()  # Make sure we’re only working with rows that have all 2-6 person family values

# Identify counties where income decreases at any step (e.g. 4-person < 3-person)
df_income_decreasing <- df_income_wide %>%
  filter(`3-person families` < `2-person families` |
         `4-person families` < `3-person families` |
         `5-person families` < `4-person families` |
         `6-person families` < `5-person families`)

**Question: Are there any counties where income decreases as family size
increases?**

**Observations**:

- Most of the counties experience the most extreme decline in median
  income from 5-6 person households.

- The county with the highest median income changes for family size.

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
