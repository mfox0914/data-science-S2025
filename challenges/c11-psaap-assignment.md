*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying
“pure sampling” of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI
with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful
notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation
data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and
PI) to support engineering design.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation
campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub)
that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat
transfer to fluid-suspended particles\[1\]. These simulations were
carried out to help study a novel design of [solar
receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power),
though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device
design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your
local `./data/` folder.

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An
example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial
simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with
particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain
(RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right).
Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent
fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect
heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image
shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are “hot spots” where hot
particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap`
gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at
various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

**Observations**:

- The x column is at a constant 0.25.
- The dataset does not seem to give units.
- Number of particles is typically in the millions.

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the
normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat
transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column
of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions
`W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

``` r
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx
df_psaap %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = T_norm, group = idx, color = as.factor(idx))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 0.75)
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation
sets.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors
(features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we
should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to
include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the
flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because
fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and
thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables—at least at a *high level*—can help us to
avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You’ll explore
this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance
df_validate %>%
  rmse(model = fit_baseline)
```

    ## [1] 0.2844778

``` r
df_validate %>%
  rmse(model = fit_cheat)
```

    ## [1] 0.2317709

``` r
df_validate %>%
  rmse(model = fit_nonphysical)
```

    ## [1] 0.3988128

**Observations**:

- Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
  - The fit_cheat model is the most accurate, with the lowest RMSE of
    0.2318. The fit_nonphysical model is the least accurate, with the
    highest RMSE of 0.3988.
- What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective
  predictor?
  - avg_T is an output variable. It’s an effective predictor of T_norm
    because T_norm is directly calculated from it, so it captures
    essentially the same physical information.
- Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new*
  value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
  - No, we wouldn’t have access to avg_T if we were trying to predict
    new values. It’s a post-simulation output, so we need pre-computed
    values of T-norm to use it. Therefore, using avg_T to predict T_norm
    gives us a misleadingly good performance and isn’t a valid predictor
    for real-world use.
- What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical
  meaning?
  - idx is metadata. It’s just an identifier for the simulation run and
    has no physical meaning. It doesn’t describe or influence the
    physics of the system, so using it as a predictor doesn’t make sense
    and can result in overfitting or meaningless relationships.

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from
fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

``` r
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)

**Observations**:

- Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories
  do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of
  the model?
  - The excluded columns are idx, avg_q, avg_T, and rms_T. These are
    important to leave out because avg_q, avg_T, and rms_T are output
    variables. They’re calculated after the physical processes occur, so
    they aren’t available when predicting new outcomes. idx is just a
    simulation ID with no physical meaning. It could lead to overfitting
    by capturing simulation-specific quirks.
- Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
  - W, x, L, U_0, C_fp, d_p, and I\_\_0
- What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression
  coefficient for `T_f`?
  - x’s regression coefficient is 1.018. T_f’s regression coefficient is
    -0.0003791.
- What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the
  standard deviation of `T_f`?
  - The standard deviation of x is 0.2805121, and T_f is 38.94204.
- How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients
  for `x` and `T_f`?
  - The regression coefficient shows how much T_norm changes per
    one-unit change in the input variable, but the standard deviation
    shows how much that input typically varies. For x, a coefficient of
    1.018 combined with a standard deviation of 0.28 means changes in x
    can cause noticeable shifts in T_norm. For T_f, even though it has a
    much larger standard deviation, its tiny coefficient (-0.0003791)
    means its overall effect on T_norm is minimal. Thus, both the size
    of the coefficient and the natural variability of a variable are
    important for understanding its practical impact on the model.
- Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on
  the output `T_norm`; so they are all “significant” in that sense. What
  does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance
  for interpreting regression coefficients?
  - A variable with a strong physical effect but high variance or
    correlation with other variables might not appear significant.
    Statistical significance reflects certainty in a variable’s effect,
    not the size of that effect.

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let’s revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction
intervals (PI). Let’s fit a very simple model to these data, one which
only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We’ll
also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the
`setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the
objects they are attempting to capture:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),

  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the
mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet
we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation`
observations.

**Punchline**:

- Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
- Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but
the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to
*narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions.
Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in
uncertainty. We’ll see this phenomenon in action with the following
task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

``` r
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.

**Observations**:

- Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this
  predicted-vs-actual plot?
  - The q4 model is more accurate. The predicted values are generally
    closer to the diagonal line representing perfect prediction. There’s
    less vertical spread around the line compared to the x-only model.
- Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put
  differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
  - The fit_q4 model appears more confident. We can tell because the
    vertical lines/prediction intervals are narrower on average compared
    to those in the x-only model. Narrower intervals mean the model has
    less uncertainty in its predictions.
- How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make
  a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
  - fit_simple uses only one predictor: x. fit_q4 uses seventeen
    predictors: x, L, W, U_0, N_p, k_f, T_f, rho_f, mu_f, lam_f, C_fp,
    rho_p, d_p, C_pv, h, I_0, and eps_p.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every
reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the
best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for
example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our
control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example,
it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by
having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is
*patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component*
that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases—human behavior and variable material properties—we would
be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are
at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some
inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that
uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the
uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as
predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term
$\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue
strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate
successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in
the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according
to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team
a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed
design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below
(use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level`
argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the
appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which
variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have
chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing
a CI or PI for the design prediction.

``` r
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
fit_q6 <- lm(T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0, data = df_train)

# Add prediction interval at the design point
df_design_pi <- add_uncertainties(
  data = df_design,
  model = fit_q6,
  interval = "prediction",
  level = pr_level,
  prefix = "pi"
)

df_design_pi %>% 
  select(pi_fit, pi_lwr, pi_upr)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   pi_fit pi_lwr pi_upr
    ##    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1   1.88   1.46   2.30

``` r
df_validate_pi <- add_uncertainties(
  data = df_validate,
  model = fit_q6,
  interval = "prediction",
  level = pr_level,
  prefix = "pi"
)

mean(
  df_validate$T_norm >= df_validate_pi$pi_lwr &
  df_validate$T_norm <= df_validate_pi$pi_upr
)
```

    ## [1] 0.9333333

**Recommendation**:

- How much do you trust your model? Why?
  - I have a fairly high level of trust in this model. It performs well
    on the training data, and its prediction intervals successfully
    capture about 93% of the validation observations, which is higher
    than the target 80% level. This suggests the model is reasonably
    well-calibrated for this application.
- What kind of interval—confidence or prediction—would you use for this
  task, and why?
  - A prediction interval is appropriate here because the team is trying
    to design around the range of actual outcomes, not just the mean
    trend.
- What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you
  predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the
  validation data*; don’t just use one single interval!) How does this
  compare with `pr_level`?
  - About 93% of the validation cases fall within the predicted 80%
    prediction intervals. This is slightly higher than the target
    pr_level = 0.8, which indicates the model might be slightly
    conservative.
- What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan
  around?
  - The design team should plan around a T_norm interval of
    approximately \[1.457, 2.296\]. This prediction interval is based on
    their proposed design (x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U₀ = 1.0) and
    captures about 80% of possible T_norm outcomes, satisfying their
    reliability requirement.
- Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
  - Yes, I would recommend investigating whether additional controllable
    inputs could further narrow uncertainty. Running sensitivity
    analysis on the uncontrolled variables to understand which ones
    contribute most to the variability in T_norm.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend
which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could
do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An
exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the
variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
