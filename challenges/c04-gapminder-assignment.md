*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

``` r
gapminder %>%
  pull(continent) %>%
  unique()
```

    ## [1] Asia     Europe   Africa   Americas Oceania 
    ## Levels: Africa Americas Asia Europe Oceania

**Observations**:

- Country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <- 
  gapminder %>%
  pull(year) %>%
  max()
  
year_min <- 
  gapminder %>%
  pull(year) %>%
  min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The mean for all continents falls between 1000 and 10000. The median
  for all continents does not pass 1\*10^4.
- Oceania has both the smallest GDP per capita spread and the highest
  median, suggesting the GDP per capita of its countries is relatively
  similar, or the number of countries located in Oceania is very small.
- The Americas and Asia have noticeable outliers, with Asia having a
  very high outlier.
- Asia has the largest spead.
- All the outliers seem to be greater than the upper bound, not lower.

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- I originally tried a scatter plot, but the points were so close
  together it was difficult to tell where they were, and I was also not
  entirely sure were the outliers were except for one. I then tried a
  boxplot, which made it much easier to visualize the range of the data
  and see where outliers were.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>%
  filter(continent == 'Africa') %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %>%
  head(2)
```

    ## 1 Switzerland Europe     1952    69.6 4815000    14734.

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - Africa: South Africa, Gabon
  - Americas: USA, Canada, Venezuela
  - Asia: Kuwait, Bahrain
  - Europe: Switzerland

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(year_min, year_max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, group = interaction(continent, factor(year)))) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = factor(year))) +  # Boxplots colored by year
  geom_point(
    data = gapminder %>% filter(year %in% c(year_min, year_max), 
                                country %in% c("South Africa", "Gabon", "United States", "Canada", "Venezuela", "Kuwait", "Bahrain", "Switzerland")),
    aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, color = country, shape = factor(year)),  # Differentiate years
    size = 2,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)  # Properly align dots with boxplots
  ) +
  labs(color = "Country / Year", shape = "Year") +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
gapminder %>%
  filter(year %in% c(year_min, year_max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, group = interaction(continent, factor(year)))) +

  geom_point(
    data = gapminder %>% 
      filter(year %in% c(year_min, year_max), 
             country %in% c("United States", "Kuwait", "Switzerland")),  # ✅ Correct filter
    aes(x = continent, y = gdpPercap, color = country, shape = factor(year)),  # Differentiate by country and year
    size = 2,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75) # Properly align dots with boxplots
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("orange", "black", "red", "green", "blue"), # Assign colors
    labels = c(year_min, year_max, "Kuwait", "Switzerland", "United States") # Ensure proper labeling
  ) +
  labs(color = "Country / Year", shape = "Year")
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The median and range tended to increase between 1952 and 2007 - does
  this dataset take inflation into account?
- Kuwait’s GDP decreased significantly between 1952 and 2007, it is the
  only 1952 outlier country to show this behavior.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph - Life Expectancy vs. Time
gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp, group = interaction(continent, factor(year)))) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = factor(year)))  # Boxplots colored by year
```

- For all continents life expectancy increased over time.
- This could imply that life expectancy and GDP are directly related.

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph - Median Life Expectancy vs. GDP for all continents
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  mutate(med_lifeExp = median(lifeExp), med_gdpPercap = median(gdpPercap)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = med_gdpPercap, y = med_lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = continent), size = 0.6)
```

- Africa, Asia, and the Americas had sharp increases in life expectancy
  while their GDP did not change nearly as much.
- Europe and Oceania were the opposite and had greater changes in GDP
  than life expectancy.
- For all continents life expectancy tended to increase with GDP, giving
  evidence to the hypothesis made in the first graph.
- However, the increase was different for all countries, implying that
  GDP was not the only factor influencing life expectancy, and vice
  versa.

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph - Life Expectancy vs. Population
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  mutate(med_lifeExp = median(lifeExp), med_pop = median(pop)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = med_pop, y = med_lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = continent), size = 0.6)
```

``` r
# Compute median life expectancy for the earliest year
min_year_lifeexp <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_min) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(min_med_lifeExp = median(lifeExp), .groups = "drop")

# Compute median life expectancy for the latest year
max_year_lifeexp <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == year_max) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_med_lifeExp = median(lifeExp), .groups = "drop")

# Join datasets and calculate the difference
lifeexp_change <- min_year_lifeexp %>%
  inner_join(max_year_lifeexp, by = "continent") %>%
  mutate(lifeExp_difference = max_med_lifeExp - min_med_lifeExp)
```

- Population and life expectancy are related, when one increases, so
  does the other.
- For most continents, life expectancy plateaus once it reaches a
  certain point.
