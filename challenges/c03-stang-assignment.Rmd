*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes, the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this challenge you'll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Effort | Some task **q**'s left unattempted | All task **q**'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Submission

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Make sure to commit both the challenge report (`report.md` file) and supporting files (`report_files/` folder) when you are done! Then submit a link to Canvas. **Your Challenge submission is not complete without all files uploaded to GitHub.**

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a number of Aluminum plates to determine their [elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and [Poisson's ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio). These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such as aircraft skin under [buckling loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking)) direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data for this challenge.

```{r load}
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
df_stang
```

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special value for `names_to`.

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c("thick", "alloy"),
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>%
  distinct()
  

df_stang_long
```

Use the following tests to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
              setequal(
                df_stang_long %>% names,
                c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "nu")
              )
            )
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
              (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
            )

print("Very good!")
```

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you'd like to answer about the data---you'll answer it below in q3.

```{r q2-task}
df_stang_long %>%
  head()
df_stang_long %>%
  glimpse()
df_stang_long %>%
lapply(unique)

```

**Observations**:

-   Is there "one true value" for the material properties of Aluminum?
    -   No, because elasticity and Poisson's ratio vary with angle and thickness.
-   How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
    -   There is only 1 aluminum alloy in this dataset because when you look at all the unique values of each column there is only one value for alloy, "al_24st".
-   What angles were tested?
    -   0, 45, and 90 degrees.
-   What thicknesses were tested?
    -   0.022, 0.032, 0.064, 0.081
-   Are there any values that look out of place?
    -   There is a value of negative 1 that is in both the E and nu columns. This number does not seem to make physical sense based on research and differs greatly from the other values in both those columns, suggesting this may be an error or a placeholder.
-   What is the range of values for E and nu?
    -   The values for E range from 9900 to 10700.
    -   The values for nu range from 0.310 to 0.331.
-   How do E and nu vary with thickness?

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here'
df_stang_long %>%
   filter(E != -1, nu != -1) %>% # Remove the -1 outlier
  ggplot(aes(x = thick, y = E)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r q3}
df_stang_long %>%
   filter(E != -1, nu != -1) %>% # Remove the -1 outlier
  ggplot(aes(x = thick, y = nu)) +
    geom_point()
```

**Observations**:

-   The values of E generally decrease as thickness increases.
-   There are 26 rows but only 12 points, suggesting that E values are repeated for the same thickness.
-   There is noticeable variation in E for the same thickness, which could be due to the angle variation in the dataset.
-   The trend of nu vs. thickness is similar to the trend of E vs. thickness.
-   There is a larger range of values for nu for one thickness as opposed to E.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> "A material's property (or material property) is an intensive property of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the amount of the material."[2]

Note that the "amount of material" would vary with the thickness of a tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim that "elasticity `E` is an intensive material property." Why or why not? Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

```{r q4-vis}
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%
  filter(E != -1, nu != -1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Observations**:

-   Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
    -   The graph is showing that E varies with thickness, though the value of E is generally close for the same thickness.
    -   This suggests that E is not a purely intensive material property in this dataset and therefore contradicts the claim above.
-   Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
    -   No, because the values are clustered together for the same thickness value, it can be inferred that the observed variation in E could be caused by measurement errors, differences in how samples were prepared, or other external influences.
